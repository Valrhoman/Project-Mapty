# Project-Mapty

Hi! This short project was part of learning JavaScript object-oriented programming, geolocation, external libraries, etc. in the course 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!' by Jonas Schmedtmann. I wrote the codes by following Jonas' lectures and demos.

Mapty is an amazing, simple application that enables the user to log their exercise (running or cycling) activities on a digital map like Google Maps. Enjoy seeing it at the link below! ðŸ˜€
